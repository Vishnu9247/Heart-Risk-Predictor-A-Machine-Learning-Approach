## Heart Disease Risk Prediction Project
### Overview
This project aims to predict the risk of heart disease using machine learning algorithms applied to a dataset containing various health-related attributes. The dataset is preprocessed, analyzed, and utilized to build predictive models that can assist in identifying individuals at risk of heart disease.

### Project Structure
The project is organized into several main steps:

#### Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

The dataset is imported and inspected using summary statistics (describe(), info()).
Data cleaning steps, such as handling missing values and outliers, are performed.
Categorical features are encoded, and numerical features are normalized to prepare the data for modeling.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizations, such as count plots for categorical features and box plots for numerical features, are used to understand the data distribution and relationships.
Model Building:

#### Implementation of machine learning models:
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
(Include other models as applicable)
Custom implementations of these models may be found in separate files (LogisticRegression.ipynb, KNN.ipynb).

#### Model Evaluation:
Models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Cross-validation techniques and train-test splits are utilized to validate model performance.
